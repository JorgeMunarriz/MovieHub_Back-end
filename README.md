# MovieHub_Back-end ðŸŽ¬


Welcome to the MovieHub project, an application to keep track of the movies you are watching. This project is designed to help you learn and practice your backend development skills. Throughout the project, you will be adding functionalities and refactoring your code as you learn new concepts.

## Project Description
MovieHub is an application that allows you to manage a list of movies. Each movie in the application has a name, a poster, a score, and a genre. You will be able to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on these movies.

The frontend of the application is built with React. In the user interface, you will be able to view all added movies in a list. Each movie will be displayed with its name, poster, score, and genre. There will be an option to add new movies through a modal or a new page, where you can enter the movie's name, upload a poster image, assign a score, and select a genre. You will also have the option to update the data of existing movies or remove them from the list.

Although the frontend of the application is important for user interaction, the main focus of this project is the backend. As you progress through the project, you will learn and apply different backend technologies and concepts, including Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Auth0, and Cloudinary. You will learn how these technologies work together to support the functionalities of the application and provide a smooth user experience.

This project is an excellent opportunity to learn and practice your backend development skills while building a functional and attractive movie management application. Good luck!

## Dependencies

The MovieHub project utilizes several libraries and technologies. Below are the main dependencies used in the project:

Frontend Dependencies:

React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Vite: Vite is a development environment for modern web applications based on JavaScript and TypeScript. It stands out for its speed and efficiency in the process of development and construction of frontend projects.
Auth0 React SDK: An SDK that integrates Auth0 authentication into the React application.
React Router: A library for handling routing within the React application.
Backend Dependencies:

Express: A fast and minimal web application framework for Node.js.
Prisma: An ORM used for database access and migration.
Auth0 Express Middleware: Middleware for Express to handle Auth0 authentication.
Cloudinary: A cloud-based service for storing and transforming media content.
Database:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store movie data (prior to PostgreSQL migration).
Dev Dependencies:

TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript used to add type safety.
Nodemon: A utility that automatically restarts the Node.js server on file changes (for development).
ESLint: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in JavaScript code.
Prettier: A code formatter used to enforce code style consistency.
